shm and shm_wrapper - Python access to System V shared memory and semaphores
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

shm is a Python module (written by Vladimir Marangozov) that gives access to
System V shared memory and semaphores on *nix systems. shm_wrapper (written
by me) is an optional companion module that gives more Pythonic access.
Windows users, you're out of luck here; these modules only work on platforms
that support System V shared objects. Most *nixes do (including OS X) but
Windows does not.

The latest version, contact info, etc. are available here:
http://NikitaTheSpider.com/python/shm/

Installation is as simple as `sudo python setup.py`. Usage, a version 
history, warnings, suggestions, etc. are covered in ReadMe.html.

shm and shm_wrapper are free software (free as in freedom and free as
in beer). Licensing information is available in the LICENSE file.

Enjoy,
