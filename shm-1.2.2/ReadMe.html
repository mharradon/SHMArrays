	<title>Nikita The Spider * Python IPC - Modules shm and shm_wrapper</title>

</head>
<body>

<h2>IPC with Python - System V Shared Memory and Semaphores</h2>

<p>This describes the module <tt>shm</tt> (written by Vladimir Marangozov) that gives access
to System V shared memory and semaphores on *nix systems as well the module
<tt>shm_wrapper</tt>
(written by <a name="contact" href="http://NikitaTheSpider.com/contact.html">me</a>) which is a
companion module that offers more Pythonic access. Windows users, you're out of luck here; these
modules only work on platforms that support System V shared objects. Most *nixes do
(including OS X) but Windows does not.
</p>

<p><strong>You can download <a href="shm-1.2.2.tar.gz">shm version 1.2.2</a> which contains
<a href="#shm_wrapper">the module <tt>shm_wrapper</tt></a>,
<a href="#shm">the module <tt>shm</tt></a>, installation instructions and
<a href="#samples">sample code</a>. You might also want to read
about some <a href="#KnownBugs">known bugs</a>.</strong>
</p>

<h2>The Modules</h2>

<p>There's two modules available here. <strong><tt>shm</tt> is essential</strong>.
It is a single
C language file that compiles into a Python module. The module's functions and features
map fairly closely to the system calls like <tt>shmctl</tt>, but with nicer names.
</p>

<p>The module <strong><tt>shm_wrapper</tt> offers easier-to-use, higher-lever access to
<tt>shm</tt>'s features.</strong> For example, <tt>shm</tt> memory objects support
reading the object's permissions through the <tt>perm</tt> attribute but you must set them
by calling <tt>setperm()</tt>. By contrast, <tt>shm_wrapper</tt> exposes a simple
gettable/settable attribute called <tt>permissions</tt>.
</p>

<p><tt>shm_wrapper</tt> also allows you to ignore the messy details surrounding keys and
ids for the objects. Since the fact that <a href="#ftok"><tt>ftok()</tt> is broken on most
(all?) modern systems</a> makes keys not very useful, there's no reason for you to spend
time messing with them if you can avoid doing so.
</p>

<h3>Which Should You Use?</h3>

<p>If you're an old (or young) Sys V hacker, you might prefer <tt>shm</tt>'s "closer to 
the metal" feel. Otherwise, use <tt>shm_wrapper</tt>.
</p>

<h2><a name="shm_wrapper"><tt>shm_wrapper</tt></a></h2>

<p>This module provides classes that act as handles to shared memory and semaphores as well as
functions to create and destroy each. Memory segments and semaphores are distinguished
from one another by a guaranteed-unique key that this module generates automatically when
the object is created.
</p>

<h3><tt>shm_wrapper</tt> Functions</h3>

<dl>
    <dt>create_memory(size, permissions = 0666, InitCharacter = '&nbsp;')</dt>
    <dd>Creates a shared memory segment and returns a SharedMemoryHandle instance (described
        below). Each byte of the memory will be initialized to InitCharacter. If you pass
        a multibyte character for that parameter, the results are undefined. You can
        destroy the memory either by calling <tt>remove_memory()</tt> or by calling the
        <tt>.remove()</tt> method on a handle to said memory.
    </dd>
    <dt>remove_memory(key)</dt>
    <dd>Removes (releases) the shared memory identified by <tt>key</tt>. Raises
        <tt>KeyError</tt> if no shared memory has that key.
    </dd>
    <dt>create_semaphore(InitialValue = 1, permissions = 0666)</dt>
    <dd>Creates a semaphore and returns a SemaphoreHandle instance (described below). You can
        destroy the semaphore either by calling <tt>remove_semaphore()</tt> or by calling the
        <tt>.remove()</tt> method on a handle to said semaphore.
    </dd>
    <dt>remove_semaphore(key)</dt>
    <dd>Destroys the semaphore identified by <tt>key</tt>. Raises
        <tt>KeyError</tt> if no semaphore has that key.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3><tt>shm_wrapper</tt> Class - SharedMemoryHandle</h3>

<p>This is a handle to a piece of shared memory that allows you to read and write to the memory
and manipulate its attributes. Important methods and attributes are below. Not all of the
attributes are documented here; refer to the module itself for information on some of the
more obscure ones.
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>read(NumberOfBytes = 0, offset = 0)</dt>
    <dd>Reads the specified number of bytes from position offset and returns a string.</dd>
    <dt>write(s, offset = 0)</dt>
    <dd>Writes the string s to position offset.</dd>
    <dt>remove()</dt>
    <dd>Removes (releases) the shared memory. If any process tries to access it
        after calling <tt>.remove()</tt>, the results are system-dependent  (but will
        probably be unpleasant).
    </dd>
    <dt>key (read only)</dt>
    <dd>The integer key that identifies this segment. By passing the key to other processes,
        the process that created the shared memory gives them the ability to find it easily.
    </dd>
    <dt>size (read only)</dt>
    <dd>The size of the segment in bytes.</dd>
    <dt>permissions</dt>
    <dd>The permissions on this memory.</dd>
</dl>


<h3><tt>shm_wrapper</tt> Class - SemaphoreHandle</h3>

<p>This is a handle to a semaphore that allows you to wait on the semaphore and also read
and write to its attributes. Important methods and attributes are below. Not all of the
attributes are documented here; refer to the module itself for information on some of the
more obscure ones.
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>P()</dt>
    <dd>Blocks while the semaphore is zero and, once unblocked, decrements it. Stands for
        <span lang="nl">prolaag</span> or <span lang="nl">probeer te verlagen</span>
        (try to decrease).
    </dd>
    <dt>V()</dt>
    <dd>Increments the semaphore. Stands for <span lang="nl">verhoog</span> (increase).</dd>
    <dt>Z()</dt>
    <dd>Blocks until zee zemaphore is zero.</dd>
    <dt>remove()</dt>
    <dd>Removes (destroys) the semaphore. If any process tries to access it
        after calling <tt>.remove()</tt>, the results are system-dependent (but will
        probably be unpleasant).
    </dd>
    <dt>key (read only)</dt>
    <dd>The integer key that identifies this semaphore. By passing the key to other processes,
        the process that created the semaphore gives them the ability to find it easily.
    </dd>
    <dt>value</dt>
    <dd>The semaphore's value.</dd>
    <dt>permissions</dt>
    <dd>The permissions on this semaphore.</dd>
    <dt>blocking</dt>
    <dd>Turns blocking mode on or off. In non-blocking mode, <tt>P()</tt> and <tt>Z()</tt>
        will merely raise <tt>shm.error</tt> if the semaphore is unavailable.</dd>
    <dt>undo</dt>
    <dd>Turns the SEM_UNDO flag on or off, but I believe support for SEM_UNDO is OS
        dependent.</dd>
    <dt>WaitingForZero (read only)</dt>
    <dd>The number of processes waiting for this semaphore to hit zero (i.e. waiting in
        a call to <tt>.Z()</tt>).</dd>
    <dt>WaitingForNonZero (read only)</dt>
    <dd>The number of processes waiting for this semaphore to hit non-zero (i.e. waiting in
        a call to <tt>.P()</tt>).</dd>
</dl>


<h2><a name="shm"><tt>shm</tt></a></h2>

<p>Vladimir Marangozov's <tt>shm</tt> module is the core of the onion, so to speak. It is a

<h3>Version History</h3>

<ul id="history">
    <li><strong>Current &ndash; 1.2.2 (11 May 2008) &ndash;</strong> Changed the __del__() 
        method in shm_wrapper's SharedMemoryHandle object to avoid referring to the shm 
        module since that module might not be available during deletion. Thanks to René
        Neumann for the bug report and patch.
	</li>
	
    <li>1.2.1 (11 Apr 2008) &ndash; No code change. I forgot
        to update the version string in version 1.2's setup.py, so that version installed 
        itself claiming to be 1.1.4 even though it wasn't. That's now corrected. I also
        added the missing "INSTALL" file. Thanks to Jeff Schwab for letting me know it 
        was missing.
	</li>
	
    <li>1.2 (27 Jan 2008) &ndash; Now thread-friendly!
		 Patch provided by James Teh (thanks!). Also fixed some int/long/ulong sloppiness
		 pointed out by kAbY that could cause crashes on 64-bit platforms.
	</li>
	
    <li>1.1.4 (10 Jan 2008) &ndash;
    	<ul>
        	<li>Changed setup.py to use Python 2.2-friendly syntax.</li>
			<li>Undid the "fix" I'd applied in 1.1.3 and replaced it with code that properly
				detects which flavor the ipc_perm struct your system has. Thanks to Aaron 
				Lindsey and Bill Codington.</li>
		</ul>
    </li>
    <li>1.1.3 (23 November 2007) &ndash; Changed #define of key to 
		_key instead of __key for OS X Leopard. Thanks to Bill Hart.
    </li>
    <li>1.1.2 (18 November 2007) &ndash; <tt>shm_wrapper</tt> now
		installed by default since it is the recommended interface for using this code.
		Fixed an implicit cast of size_t to unsigned int in the repr function that was 
		exposed by compiling against Python 2.5. Also updated setup.py to be a bit nicer. 
    </li>
    <li>1.1.1 (5 March 2007) &ndash; Updated setup.py with compile
        options that work for Linux users.
    </li>
    <li>1.1 (8 February 2007) &ndash; Rereleased <tt>shm</tt> after
    it had languished a bit in recent years. This version contains a number of fixes
    and changes as well as the new companion module <tt>shm_wrapper</tt>.
    <ul>
        <li>Created <tt>shm_wrapper</tt> to give a more consistent and Pythonic interface.</li>
        <li>Fixed a memory leak in <tt>PyShm_memory()</tt> and <tt>PyShm_semaphore()</tt>
            spotted by
            <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/msg/54964f985c4a3dc4">Jon
            Corbet</a>.
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a memory leak in <tt>PyShm_create_memory()</tt> and
            <tt>PyShm_create_semaphore()</tt> related to inlining <tt>Py_BuildValue()</tt>.
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a typo that caused <tt>xxx_setuid()</tt> to set the group id instead.</li>
        <li>Changed <tt>PyMem_DEL</tt> to <tt>PyObject_Del</tt> in the <tt>_dealloc</tt>
            functions for Python 2.5. Thanks to Jason Tackaberry/Pierre Ossman.
        </li>
        <li>Fixed <tt>sprintf()</tt> in <tt>PyShmMemory_repr()</tt> to use the correct
            format.</li>
        <li>Added the ability to read the blocking mode of a semaphore.</li>
        <li>Changed the function prototypes from K&amp;R style so that compiling with
            <tt>-Wstrict-prototypes</tt> is now clean.</li>
        <li>Added an #ifdef for happy compiles under FreeBSD.</li>
        <li>Added a setup.py file.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>1.0 (sometime in the 1990s) - Original version by Vladimir Marangozov.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Interesting Tools</h3>

<p>Many systems (although not some versions of OS X) come with <tt>ipcs</tt> and <tt>ipcrm</tt>.
The former shows existing shared memory, semaphores and message queues on your system and
the latter allows you to remove them.
</p>

<h3>SHM and Threads</h3>

<p>As of version 1.2, <tt>shm</tt> should be safe to use in threaded applications. (Previous 
versions were not).
</p>

<h3><a name="samples">Sample Code</a></h3>

<p>The tarball includes code demonstrating the use of both <tt>shm_wrapper</tt> and
<tt>shm</tt>. The demo code comes in the form of two complementary applications
(two apps for each demo = a total of four apps). The apps are called Mrs. Premise and
Mrs. Conclusion (as in, "Four hours to bury a cat?") and they converse with one another through
shared memory. Run Mrs. Premise in one terminal and Mrs. Conclusion in another.
</p>

<p>
The conversation starts with Mrs. Premise creating the shared memory and then seeding it
with a random string. Mrs. Conclusion then calculates the md5 hash of this string and writes
that back into the shared memory. Mrs. Premise calculates the md5 hash of <em>that</em>
string and writes it to the shared memory, and so it goes back and forth for as many
iterations as are specified. Using md5 hashes allows Mrs. Premise and Mrs. Conclusion to
verify that the other process correctly read what was written because it makes the
response predictable. This is important for detecting memory corruption (see below).
</p>

<p>You can specify whether or not you want the flow of the conversation to be controlled with
a semaphore. (This option as well as the number of iterations are specified in
<tt>DemoConstants.py</tt>.) If you opt not to use the semaphore, memory corruption (i.e.
a "simultaneous" write by both processes to the shared memory) will
probably occur if you run enough iterations. On my test systems -- a G4 Powerbook and
a PIII running FreeBSD -- memory corruption always happened in less than 5000 iterations.
If you use the semaphore, memory corruption will not occur. When either process detects
corruption, it raises an <tt>AssertionError</tt>.
</p>

<p>In addition to demonstrating the use of <tt>shm_wrapper</tt> and <tt>shm</tt>, this demo
also illustrates why one needs to be careful with shared memory programming. Consider that
even without semaphores these two processes writing to the same bit of memory as fast as
they can <em>still</em> require thousands of iterations to step on one another. Now imagine
a similarly infrequent bug, but instead of one that's caused by two deliberately careless demo
programs, imagine one buried in thousands of lines of your code that causes Some Random
Event every two weeks or so. You don't want to have to track down a bug like that.
Speaking of bugs...
</p>


<h3><a name="KnownBugs">Known Bugs</a></h3>

<p>Bugs? My code never has bugs! However, there is a <em>suboptimal anomoly</em>...</p>

<p>If I'm correctly interpreting what I see when I run <tt>top</tt>, the newest version of
<tt>shm</tt> <em>still</em> leaks memory during the create/destroy cycle of
both Memory and Semaphore objects. This happens despite plugging several existing memory leaks
and despite the fact that Python's garbage collector doesn't report anything amiss.
The leak is tiny (about 12 or 13 bytes per create/destroy cycle) and it is released when
the Python process ends, so this will only be a problem if you have a long-running process
that creates and destroys lots of these objects. Note that the leaks occur only when
creating (or destroying) <strong>new</strong> objects. Getting a handle to an existing
object doesn't cause a problem.
</p>

<p>I created <a href="MemoryLeakDemo.py">a simple program called MemoryLeakDemo.py</a>
that demonstrates the problem. Start it in one window with <tt>top</tt> running in another
window and you can watch the python process eat memory.
</p>

<h3><a name="ftok">About <tt>ftok</tt> &ndash; Use It At Your Own Peril</a></h3>

<p>Most sample code that you see involving the use of System V semaphores/shared memory
recommends <tt>ftok()</tt> to generate an integer key that's guaranteed to be unique on
that machine. The main convenience of this is that processes can get the key (and thus a
handle to the shared memory or semaphore) simply by using a previously agreed-upon filename.
<strong>However,
most modern implementations of <tt>ftok</tt> don't guarantee that it returns a unique key</strong>, 
which means it creates a key that may or may not work. If it doesn't work you have to fall 
back on a reliable alternative method of key
generation, so you might as well just use the alternative in the first place.
</p>
<p>The operating systems affected by this
include <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/ftok.3.html">OS X</a>,
Open/Net/<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ftok&amp;sektion=3&amp;apropos=0&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+6.2-RELEASE">FreeBSD</a>,
and <a href="http://man.cx/?page=ftok&amp;do%5Bgo%5D=go">Linux</a>. (See the BUGS or NOTES section
of the referenced man pages.)

<p>
In my experience, <tt>ftok</tt> frequently returned duplicate keys for different files in the
same directory on my G4 Powerbook. Rather than probing and documenting <tt>ftok</tt>'s
limitations, I decided to just avoid it entirely and rely on Python's random number
generator to provide keys for me. It's not as convenient as using a previously agreed-upon
filename as a key, but buggy implementations of <tt>ftok</tt> don't (reliably) provide
that either. One alternative is to have the creating process generate a random key and write
that to a previously agreed-upon file.
</p>

<h3><a name="compiling">Potential Compile Problems</a></h3>
<p><strong>Please
<a name="contact" href="http://NikitaTheSpider.com/contact.html">let me know</a> if you find
a platform for which shm doesn't compile as-is.</strong></p>

<p>On some systems, you might get this error when compiling:</p>

<pre>shmmodule.c:186: error: redefinition of `union semun'</pre>

<p>If you see this compile error, then you need to add your platform in setup.py to
the if statement just above where HAVE_UNION_SEMUN is added.

<p>Also, I suspect that BSD users (other than FreeBSD-ers) might see something like this:</p>

<pre>shmmodule.c:1375: error: `PAGE_SIZE' undeclared (first use in this function)</pre>

<p>You probably need to <tt>#include &lt;machine/param.h&gt;</tt>. That's already done
for FreeBSD thanks to an <tt>#ifdef</tt>.
</p>

<p>Last but not least, version 1.1.4 introduced some fancy code in setup.py. The need for 
this comes from the ipc_perm struct in <tt>ipc.h</tt>. It contains a member that's called 
<tt>key</tt>, <tt>_key</tt> or <tt>__key</tt> depending on your system. Setup.py
should now autodetect which version you have, but the autodetection code is new and hasn't 
been well exercised (or exorcised). If if doesn't work for you and you're in a rush to 
get shm working, you can hack shmmodule.c yourself. Find the definition of the 
<tt>ipc_perm</tt> structure in <tt>/include/sys/ipc.h</tt> (<tt>/include/bits/ipc.h</tt> 
on some systems) and note which version of key it uses in its definition. Then in shmmodule.c,
replace the code instances of IPC_PERM_KEY_NAME with the variable name from ipc.h.
